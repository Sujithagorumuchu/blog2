   <center><h1>EARTHQUAKE AWARENESS</h1></center>
   <marquee directon="right" scrollamount="5"><h1>EARTHQUAKE</h1></marquee>
   <p>Earthquake activity continues to be monitored globally, with several notable events reported recently. A magnitude 4.6 earthquake struck the Maluku Sea near Pulau Mayu Island, Indonesia, on November 17, 2024, at a depth of 10 km. This region, part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, is highly seismically active. In Puerto Rico, a 2.2 magnitude earthquake occurred near Potala Pastillo at a depth of 15 km, reflecting minor but noticeable tectonic activity. Globally, earthquake patterns align with major fault lines, particularly the Pacific and Alpine-Himalayan zones, which experience frequent seismic movements. On average, over 360,000 earthquakes are detected annually, with about 15 reaching magnitude 7 or higher. <mark>Recent seismic events collectively released approximately 2.7 x 10¹³ joules of energy, highlighting their significant geological impact.</mark></p>

<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
    <h4>1. Primary Effects</h4>
    <li>Ground Shaking: Vibrations caused by seismic waves can collapse buildings, roads, and bridges.</li>
    <li>Surface Rupture: The Earth's surface may crack or shift along the fault line, damaging infrastructure and landscapes.</li>
    <li>Ground Displacement: Land can move vertically or horizontally, disrupting railways, pipelines, and power lines.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
    <h4>2. Secondary Effects</h4>
    <li>Landslides and Avalanches: Ground shaking in mountainous areas can trigger landslides and rockfalls.</li>
    <li>Tsunamis: Underwater earthquakes can displace water and create massive waves, devastating coastal areas.</li>
    <li>Soil Liquefaction: Saturated soil loses its solidity during shaking, causing buildings and roads to sink or tilt.</li>
    <li>Fires: Damage to gas lines and electrical systems often leads to fires after earthquakes.</li>
    <li>Flooding: Earthquakes can cause dams to collapse or rivers to change course, resulting in floods.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
    <h4>3. Tertiary Effects</h4>
    <li>Economic Loss: Destruction of buildings, businesses, and infrastructure leads to high repair and recovery costs.</li>
    <li>Displacement of People: Many people may lose their homes, requiring long-term shelter and aid.</li>
    <li>Psychological Impacts: Survivors often experience trauma, anxiety, or depression.</li>
    <li>Environmental Changes: Alterations in landscapes, such as new river courses or landforms, can impact ecosystems and agriculture.</li>
    <li>Health Issues: Limited access to clean water, food, and medical services can lead to disease outbreaks.</li>

<h3>What Causes Earthquakes?</h3>
   <li>Plate tectonics: Movement of tectonic plates (convergent, divergent, transform boundaries).</li>
   <li>Volcanic activity: Earthquakes caused by magma movement beneath volcanoes.</li>
   <li>Human-induced earthquakes: Activities like mining, reservoir-induced seismicity, and fracking.</li>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <h3> Seismic Waves:</h3>
    <li>Types: P-waves (primary), S-waves (secondary), and surface waves.</li>
    <li>Behavior: Speed, how they travel through different materials, and their role in damage.</li>
